# Emotion Soup v1.2

This project is a React Native application built with Expo. It helps children explore emotions by interacting with animated puff balls and creating their own "emotion soup".

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install required packages including `@react-native-community/slider` used on the Emotion Detail screen.
2. Run the app in Expo:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Project Structure

- `components/` reusable UI components
- `screens/` app screens
- `context/` React Context for global state
- `utils/` helper logic such as the AI personality placeholder
- `firebase.js` Firebase initialization (configure with your own keys)

This skeleton includes basic navigation and placeholder screens for future development.
